site code
=========


This is the place-holder intended to be the site page code for my site.
We use a CC by SA license named 3.0-Unported.
But that license are not in the pull down menu of Git-Hub so we have to
continue with a CC 1.0 Universal license.
The steps to write the code of the site are as follow:

1 Give the site an index.html page. We start with a Cdn from templated.co
  and from there we make the changes that fit our site. We are going to use
  photos from kodi app. So our photos are under kodi app license.

2 We are going to pull an other branch to start working with our blog for
  the users to start comment the daily feed.
  
3 ,Now is the time to implement our forum where the users are going to be
  able to register themselves to our forum wich is going to give later a 
  list of users names and email addresses to us. So we gonna have mesure 
  of our audience of p√•otencial clients to our site. Our forum is goiung to
  be implemented by an php engine wich in turn is going to use registration
  forms. The php engine is going to give an interface to our data-base of
  the site members where we keep the contact information.
